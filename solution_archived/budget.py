Write a program that reads a file and stores the output into a dictionary
Objectives:
    1) Read a file
    2) Store the contents into a dictionary
1) Read the file
    - Examine the file
    - Read the file and return output
2) Store the contents into a data structure
    - Iterate over the list and parse out components
    - Store components into dictionary
* Use print statements to help with debugging
